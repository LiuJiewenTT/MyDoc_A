# What I customized

Here is talking about *leap-day* theme.

When asked about how is the theme, I would answer:

> It's a good theme, but it has some problems if you want to build a compatible website.

## Defects

1. It has no navigation method for pages.
2. *banner* is not shown on mobile devices, so if you manually designed navigation, it would not be a good idea to put that in the *banner*.
3. There is a annoying gap if the width of your window is between `720px` to `480px`.
